Automate VirtualBox machine creation


Simple script to automate test VM creation in VirtualBox

What this does - this takes a simple number and creates the number of VMs for you

What this does not do - this does not allow for customization per VM and more suited to quickly create a test cluster where every node is of similar configuration

What about the OS - this uses Ubuntu but can be configured to use any OS as long as a OS repo is available

Where are the VMs stored - by default this saves the VMs in the default /users/foo/VirtualBox/bar folder but can be easily customised to save the VMs in any other location
